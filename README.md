#Purpose: Use Window.localStorage to store client-side data. Developed by pure JavaScript

Pros: 
	1. It is pure a client-side application, without server-side stuff(i.e. database)
	2. Easy to demostrate CRUD operation in client-side.
Cons:
	1. Performance
	2. In Chrome, need to make sure Chrome setting is allowed to access localStorage.(https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines/uncaught-securityerror-failed-to-read-the-localstorage-property-from-window-access-is-denied-for-this-document)
